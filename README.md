Project 5 is a Power BI project. In this assignment we will be illustrating data visualization skills.

In order to provide information on the time and money savings for each project and client, this project was created for NWU Tech Trends. The goal is to give stakeholders with actionable information that will drive decision-making through interactive Power BI reports.

There are three pages in the Power BI report:
High-Level Metrics: Which includes the total calculations and counts.
Project monitoring: Which is used to display the time and money saved inside the project.
Client monitoring : Which is used to display the time and money that clients are saving.

Features
Dynamic Filtering: Allows users to filter data by project, client, and other dimensions.
Interactive Visualizations: Visuals that help users understand the data at a glance.
AI Analytics: Key influencers, forecasting, and insights have been added to enhance analytics.

Prerequisites
Power BI Desktop
Access to Power BI Service (for report publishing)
Data source: Excel files provided in the eFundi Project 5 Resources folder
How to Utilize the App
Sort the report by client, project, or sector.
See which clients give the most and what causes savings by using the AI visuals.
To get a comprehensive picture of performance, flip through the three report pages.
